# Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Analysis

## Overview

This project investigates the correlation between obesity and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). By analyzing a dataset of various health parameters, we aim to identify key patterns and predictive factors that contribute to the likelihood of developing CVD, especially in individuals with obesity.

### Project Features

- **Data Exploration**: Visualize and understand how obesity impacts cardiovascular health.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and format the dataset to prepare for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Analyze the relationships between obesity-related factors and CVD risk.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Use classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict CVD risk.
- **Visualization**: Create insightful plots to visually present findings.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks
